      <p>There was, however one item on the requirements list that I was unfamilar with, and that was Durandal. I'm hip to Angular and Ember, but I had yet to use (or even hear of, quite frankly) Durandal. A quick search led me to Aurelia.js, which is the new framework from the Durandal team. It's really great, actually. Curiosity and geekiness led me to wonder whether building a quick site with Aurelia as a means to apply for the job at Brandly would be a good idea.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the merits of the idea, it quickly became a reality as I started hacking around with Aurelia and quickly put together a prototype. You can see the code for this site <a href="https://www.github.com/michaelcolenso">here.<a>
