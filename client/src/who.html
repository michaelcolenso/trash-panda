            <h2>Ambitious</h2>
            <p>I transitioned from a career in construction engineering and project management by teaching myself to code. Signed up for a <a href="https://github.com/michaelcolenso/">GitHub account</a> in May 2011 at the behest of a Ruby on Rails Tutorial (knowing nothing about git, GitHub, or web development in general) and by September 2012 I was working professionally as a full-time interactive developer for a large digital agency in Los Angeles.</p>

                <h1>I built this site because I read your job posting.</h1>
                <p>There was a particular item mentioned in the job description that I was unfamilar with, and that was Durandal. I'm hip to Angular and Ember, but I had yet to use (or even hear of, quite frankly) Durandal. A quick search led me to <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia.js</a>, which is the new framework from the Durandal team. It's really great, actually. Curiosity and geekiness led me to wonder whether building a quick site with Aurelia as a means to apply for the job at Brandly would be a good idea. Regardless of the merits of the idea, it quickly became a reality as I started hacking around with Aurelia and quickly put together a prototype. You can see the code for this site <a href="https://www.github.com/michaelcolenso">here.</a>

                I identified all of your requirements, nice-to-haves, and bonus points, and I think I match up pretty well with most of them.
